    <p class = aboutMe>Hello, I am Juan and I have designed this website to show a little bit about my passion: cities and maps! I like watching maps, collecting maps, and making maps! For work or fun it's always fun. And of course I love playing the founder, planner, designer and mayor in whatever SimCity-like game is around.<br> I love looking at city maps and explore their intricate street layouts, see what's here and there, what's missing, figure out the &quot;whys&quot; behind their many urban forms. I am a recent graduate in Urban Planning with a love for planning, maps and data. And perhaps a bit obsessed too with that pretty cool tool for putting all those together: geographic information systems. Since I came across with GIS my passion for cities took a different perspective. I was, and still, amazed by the potential combining spatial and statistical data not only for produce pretty maps, but also for revealing aspects of the city form that may otherwise remain undiscovered. <br>After my first GIS course I started making my own maps and spatial analyses and putting them everywhere; as Ken Jennings, puts it in regards to books, no matter the subject, a paper or report will always look better with a map. <br>Currently, I am writing my thesis and while doing that learning a few things a missed out during school such as online mapping, and trying to immerse myself in the world of python scripting. <br><br>If you liked my work, you can contact me at jbuzzetti [at] gmail . com. </p>
